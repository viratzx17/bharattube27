 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The deployed backend implements only part of the UI's feature set. Verified
 * live with direct probes against https://bharattube-ylmq.onrender.com/api/v1:
 *
 *   EXISTS
 *     POST /auth/login · GET /auth/me · POST /auth/logout
 *     GET  /auth/google · /auth/google/callback
 *     GET  /videos · /videos?userId= · /videos/:id
 *     POST /videos            (create — requires auth)
 *     GET  /channel/:handle
 *     GET  /search?q=
 *     GET  /notifications     (auth)
 *     GET|DELETE /history     (auth)
 *     GET|POST /playlists     (auth)
 *
 *   MISSING (verified "Route '…' not found")
 *     /auth/register · /comments · /subscriptions · /likes
 *     /videos/:id/like · /videos/:id/view · /channel/:h/subscribe
 *     /upload · /videos/upload · /media
 *
 * Features whose route is missing must show an explicit, honest state — never a
 * fake success, fake counter, or an infinite spinner.
